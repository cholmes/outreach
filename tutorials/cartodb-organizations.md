### Summary

This tutorial will walk you through the basics of CartoDB's new Multi-User functionality. As this feature is
very new this may get out of date and/or change soon.

### Getting Started

Currently a select group of CartoDB's paying users are in contact with the core team to test and give feedback on
the new Enterprise functionality. If you are interested in joining that group then get in touch, with an email
to support [at] cartodb.com. We are starting with existing customers, but soon will trial to new users as well.

A CartoDB team member will enable the functionality on your existing account. If your account is set up with 
personal name then you can request to use an alternate organization name. Users created in your
account will login to username.org-name.cartodb.com, and org-name can be your existing account name or a new one.

Once you are notified that the new functionality has been enabled you should login to your account and you should see a new option under your user name dropdown.

Click on the **Organization users** option and you'll be taken to your organization dashboard.
